# NFSU2 Save Modifier

This is a lua program to modify your NFS Underground 2 Save File.

## Usage

Currently there's only a tool to change the money in your profile.

```bash
#clone directory
$ git clone https://github.com/GComputeNerd/NFSU2-Save-Modify.git

# Change into directory
$ cd NFSU2-Save-Modify
```

Once you're in the directory get your saveFile usually located at "C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\NFS Underground 2\ProfileName\ProfileName", and copy it into the NFSU2-Save-Modify folder.

Now run the script

```bash
$ main.lua
```

It'll ask you for the name of the save file, and the amount of money you want to have, and it'll update your save. Then just copy it back to where your old save used to be.

NOTE : It's a good idea to backup your save, just in case it doesn't go well.
